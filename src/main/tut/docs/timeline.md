# Timeline

Relevant fields for quantum computing: 
* Quantum mechanics
* Computer science
* Information theory
* Cryptography

Fundamental ideas:
* **1920 Quantum Mechanics** creation of the modern theory of quantum mechanics.  

* **1936 Computer Science** Alan Turing paper on the Universal Turing Machine. 

* **1947 Computer Science** Development of the transistor. 

* **1948 Information Theory** Claude Shannon published a paper laying out the foundations for the modern theory 
of information and communication (noiseless and noisy channel coding theorem and error-correction codes).

* **1965 Computer Science** Gordon Moore's law: computer power will double for a constant cost once every two years.

* **1970 Quantum Mechanics** techniques for controlling single quantum systems. 

* **1970 Cryptography** Public key cryptography followed by RSA cryptosystem (vulnerable to Shor's quantum factorization algorithm).

* **1980 Quantum Mechanics** no-clonning theorem. 

* **1984 Cryptography** Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard proposed a protocl using quantum mechanics for key distribution. 

* **1985 Quantum Mechanics** David Deutsch proposed the Universal Quantum Computer that challenged the Universal Turing Machine. 

* **1992 Information Theory** Charles Bennett and Stephan Wiesner explained how to transmit two classical bits of information
using only one qubit (superdense coding). 

* **1994 Computer Science** Peter Shor demonstrated that the problem of finding the prime factors 
of an integer and the "discreat logarithnm" problem could be solved efficiently on a quantum computer. 

* **1995** 
    * **Computer Science** Lov Grover showed that the problem of conducting a search through some unstructured search space
    was more efficient on a quantum computer. 
    * **Information Theory** Ben Schumacher provided an analog to Shannon's noiseless coding theorem and defined the 
    qubit as a tangible physical resource.
    
* **1996  Information Theory** Discovery of an important class of quantum codes that facilitate the understanding of 
quantum error-correction codes (protect quantum states against noise).
